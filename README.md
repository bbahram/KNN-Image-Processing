# KNN Classification in Image Processing

This is a classifier that uses KNN (k nearest neighbor, a machine learning algorithm) to classify two different groups of objects in relation to each other. It uses three types of feature extraction methods: HOG, LBP, and the hybrid method, which is a combination of the first two methods.<br>
The cofusion matrix will vary for different datasets and methods.<br>
This project was written in 2020 and developed in Matlab, and it is one of my academic projects.
